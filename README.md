## Project Details

#### Part 1

- Select vertices with `Left Mouse Button` which should show the lines drawn as each vertex is selected.
- Use `Right Mouse Button` to close the polygon.
- After a polygon is fully drawn with the above steps, selection of new vertices _is not_ allowed.
- Press `F5` to reset the screen and clear any drawn objects, after which point selection is allowed again.

#### Part 3

- The polygon should be scan filled as soon as the `Right Mouse Button` is pressed to create the closed simple polygon.

#### Part 4

- Use `Left Mouse Button` to select the red vertices. They should turn green indicating they are selected.
- Use `Right Mouse Button` to move the selected vertex around. This should redraw the polygon based on the new vertex position.
- To deselect a vertex, click away from the selected vertex.
